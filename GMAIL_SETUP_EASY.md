## Step 2: Deploy Backend to Railway (5 minutes)

**Do this BEFORE creating OAuth credentials!**

1. Go to: https://railway.app/new
2. Click **Deploy from GitHub repo**
3. Select **kyliemckinleydemo/DarTrak**

**Save this URL!** You'll need it multiple times.

---

## Step 3: Finish OAuth Credentials

Back in Google Cloud Console credentials page:

**Authorized JavaScript origins:**
```
http://localhost:5173
YOUR_VERCEL_URL_HERE (add after deploying frontend)
```

**Authorized redirect URIs:**
```
http://localhost:3001/api/auth/gmail/callback
YOUR_RAILWAY_URL/api/auth/gmail/callback
```

Replace `YOUR_RAILWAY_URL` with the URL you copied from Railway.

Example:
```
https://dartrak-production-xxxx.up.railway.app/api/auth/gmail/callback
```

Click **CREATE**

**COPY THESE IMMEDIATELY:**
- Client ID: `xxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com`
- Client Secret: `GOCSPX-xxxxx`

## Step 4: Add to Railway (2 minutes)

## Step 5: Update Supabase Database (2 minutes)

  refresh_token TEXT,
  token_expiry TIMESTAMPTZ,
  email TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE gmail_tokens ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can only access their own gmail tokens" ON gmail_tokens;
CREATE POLICY "Users can only access their own gmail tokens" ON gmail_tokens
  FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Create index
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_gmail_tokens_user_id ON gmail_tokens(user_id);
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "redirect_uri_mismatch" error
- Check that `GMAIL_REDIRECT_URI` in Railway exactly matches what's in Google Cloud Console
- No trailing slashes
- Must be `https://` (not `http://`) for Railway URL

### "Access blocked" error
- Make sure you added your email as a test user in Step 1.3
- App is in testing mode - only test users can connect

### No emails showing up
- Check Railway logs for errors
- Make sure you have emails from the last 30 days
- Check that school email domain filter matches your emails

### Can't find Railway URL
- Go to Railway project → Settings tab → Domains section
