);

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE gmail_tokens ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can only access their own gmail tokens" ON gmail_tokens;
CREATE POLICY "Users can only access their own gmail tokens" ON gmail_tokens
  FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
